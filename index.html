      <h2>Student Advocacy: Stop AP Double-blocking</h2>
      <p>School administrators want to change the way Advanced Placement classes are
      scheduled at Brown Deer High School. We believe this change will hurt students and
      teachers, make scheduling more difficult, and cause programs, such as theater, music,
      fine arts, engineering, and AP itself to suffer.</p>

      <h2>Thank You Teachers</h2>
      <p>A number of teachers and staff left Brown Deer after the 2015-16 school year
      for various reasons. We wrote a letter to the teachers who were leaving and
      provided a space for students, parents, and community members to leave messages
      for the teachers who were leaving.</p>
